CNN has more bad news from Iraq today

Like everyday

More blood and more horrors

Sixty more Iraqis died

Yesterday it was thirty

Two American soldiers killed

Yesterday it was four

A severed artery – where no amount

Of direct pressure will stop the flow of blood

The bandages are porous and soaking wet

The tourniquet does not help

Last month I heard bodies are being found in Baghdad

With drill holes in them –

Drill holes from power tools – like the kind found on office furniture

From head to foot on human beings

Incredible

What people are capable of 

Doing to each other

The president speaks Texas football language

Posturing and simplicity

Saying we are winning

With all the smugness

Of a cruel child

Who threw a rock at a beehive

Hitting it directly

In the ambulance - the emergency crew works

Lights and sirens and speed

The aorta is cut

The fluid will not go in fast enough

The patient is bleeding out 

A flood of blood only exceeded

By the flow of taxpayer money to

Private American contractors

Soaking up our income tax in direct proportion

To the chaos

So much pain

So much shame

American government imperialism

Hiding behind the words freedom and democracy

Average citizens paying the price

For ideologies of men in power

Military action by the most powerful

Nation on earth

Set in motion by lies

A nine year old boy from Fallujah

His arm blown off by a machine gun bullet

A nineteen year old man from Dallas

Killed by an explosive

Placed inside a dead dog

Their true intentions 

Disguised from the beginning

Secret deals from safe places

Whose son is burned to death

Inside an army vehicle?

Whose father is tortured

Before being executed?

Not those of the people with

The means to set in motion an

Optional war

I lie in bed with my wife

And I watch some news on TV while she reads a book

I think of my government’s actions

In the world today

And in the language of my wife

One word seems appropriate:

**Vergüenza**

Shame

CNN has more bad news from Iraq today

***Vergüenza***

*Es lo que siento*

Shame

It’s what I feel
