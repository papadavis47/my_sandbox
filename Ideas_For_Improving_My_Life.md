This is going to be a long markdown document ( *written using Vim* ) that I can update anytime that I want to. Just keep adding to it and improving on it. Use it as a place to put down things everyday ( *or nearly everyday, anyway* ). Keep track of my thoughts this way. Test out ideas. Markdown things that interest me. Include quotes that I think are relevent to me. All of that. I can use it to learn and practice Vim, but also I can put blocks of code. Make note of certain links that interest me. Like these:

[Kickstart](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) *- This is a coding competition that looks very ineresting to me.*  

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) *- This is a code competition website that interests me. Atleast for when I get good enough.*

I have been thinking lately that there are three pillars I am determined to improve in my life. They are:
1. My fitness and physical health
2. My family ( being a good Dad and Husband )
3. Our Home ( As in KonMarie)
4. My professional life and dreams ( Coding and web/software development )
5. Financial wellness ( This include practical jobs until I can make money as a developer )
6. Spiritual and Mental Health ( Reading, meditation, perception, mental fitness )

Watching some fights on ESPN today. I went out twice with the boys today so that they could ride their bikes and I could get some exercise. I have eaten well today. Last nights I read some of David Goggins book, CAN'T HURT ME. That is an inspiring book. I have been keeping fitness in mind today. About ready to have some dinner of some healthy good. About to take a hot shower and get cleaned up before I watch a UFC fight - one of two that I am watching today. I found an app on Fire TV that is only $5 a  month and gets you plenty of fights. Better than spending $70 for just one fight like I did a month of two ago. I am doing some Vim practice right now. I am doing some stretching while I watch TV.


I had a good day as a Dad today.

Was out on the bikes with the boys again today. Eating well still. Learning how to do it while I am Ubering and out in my car. It takes some practice to learn how to do it while out and about. I have to learn how to substitute the junk with good food. Bananas. Cliff bars. Apples. Water. Fruit of anykind, really. 

Things are good. I have to make quite a bit of money in the Uber over the next three days, but I think I can get it done if I have a bit of luck, too. 

The fights that I watched last night were good. The one with Dillashaw and Cejudo was quicker than I would have liked but it was still good. 

Bruce Lee once said:

> Knowing is not enough, we must apply. 
> Willing is not enough, we must do.

I like this fighter Henry Cejudo. I like what he has to say in his interview. Good stuff about wanting to help people. Good stuff.

I was talking to a guy in my Uber today ( actually a Lyft ride ) and he is a developer at Facebook. He mentioned that his resume was a big deal for him. While he was in college - his resume went through 30 revisions or more. He talked about how there are steps to getting hired and the first one is the resume with a recruiter. Without the resume being able to get you to the phone interview - then you will never make it to the technical interview. So, I should really focus on getting a good resume together and keep sharpening it through my entire working career from now until the end. And I think I would like to combine that with a good LinkedIn profile. But do work on the paper resume ( or convert it to PDF, whatever, but it should be a 1 sheet). I have to start googling things about resumes and trying to get a really sharp one - if only to be apply to Whole Foods, PCC, and Metropolitan Market. Just so I can get some practice and work with resumes and use that as a jumping off point for my coding resume.

Here's a quote for the day:

> There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
> Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

_**HAMLET - William Shakespeare**_

Will get to working out with Santiago today when he comes home from school. Also, have been eating good today. Acai and cheesebread at Kitanda, and a few oranges this morning for breakfast. I am staying on the path there.

I am helping with the Chess Club at Amistad today. I have been continuing to eat well. I have to pick up some lists of the kids vaccinations from Kaiser ( Group Health ) before I drive to the school. And I am doing some Vim practice now. I am slowly making progress, but not as much as I would like. Today after I go to Amistad I am going to Uber for several hours and get some money made. It should be a pretty busy evening tonight. Pretty good money making weekend.

I am trying to move on a piece at a time with my coding. I have gotten a bit away from the linear discipline that I like to have with that. But I am still making progress and I will continue with the linear way of doing it soon. I have been jumping around a lot. I have been going over stuff that I have worked on before, but I need refreshers for.

__I have to remember that I need structure to my learning. It can not be all over the place. I need to drill down and focus on the things that I really need to move forward. Atleast I need to do some of that, combined with the free form learning when I am more tired and want to keep things fresh.__

**Keep eating well. That is helping me a lot. I feel better when I am eating well. That is what I have to focus on. I do not want to focus on weight loss. Just focus on feeling better. And I know that I do. Try to find nutritional value in everything that I eat. If it does not have nutritional value. Then don't eat it.**

I was having thoughts today about BALANCE in my life. I am thinking now, more and more, that *everything* I do, *everything* is connected. I know intellectually that the mind and body are connected. But it has taken me so long to really make that a priority and remember it on a daily basis. I am nearly 49 years old now. And it has taken me that long to really make nutrition a priority. Wellness a priority. To realize that everything I do - spend time with my kids, the way I eat, the relationship with my wife, the amount of good things I do for my health, my own professional work to make money and to do the work that I really desire - it is all connected. In the sense that when I have a healthy body then I am becoming a better coder. When I read a good book or learn something - then I am a better a Dad or husband. For so many years I have been so focused sometimes on **ONE** thing - that I missed the forest for a tree. I think I am getting better now at putting the full picture together and realizing that everything I do is interconnected. And it is never ONE thing.

I am reading a good book by David Goggins on motivation and using one's full potential. It is good stuff.

I like his stuff on discipline. That is something I see now that I have always been lacking to some degree. I have known how to work hard. But discipline, doing something even when you momentarily do no not want to, is something that I have never been good at. And it has cost me. I don't want it to cost me anymore. And I have a much larger perspective now. I will not get tunnel visioned like I used to.

Atleast I know enough now to avoid the pitfalls.

I have to focus on the fact that I love wellness and nutrition and healthy living in my cover letter and maybe on my resume. I want to express my interest in those things. I think it would help with the applications to Whole Foods and PCC and Metropolitan Market. I should try to mention something about my interest in nutritional healing and meditation, also. These are things that might be of interest to employers looking at my resume. 

I can write the actual Words either here or in Atom and then work them in from there to a Google Doc. I will probably use Atom for that one. Just to get some practice in there.

The two words that I was thinking of today are PERSPECTIVE and SUNSHINE. I have to remember that perspective can be changed. My way of looking at things can be changed quickly, by breathing, by getting some sun - by stepping away from the coins that are stuck on my eyeballs. I can change the way that I look at something by taking a step back and looking at the OVERALL - and the larger picture. Whatever the problem or challenge is.

My thoughts about sunshine came while walking to the store to check out the latest Redbox offerings and getting some sun. Today is a sunny day. And it felt so good to get my shades on and get some sun on my face. It instantly lifted my mood. Or atleast did so within a few minutes. It definitely made me think that I want to live in a sunnier climate at some point. And it made me think that I want to make good enough money at some point that I can afford to have two home where I live. One here is Seattle and one in a sunnier environment. That would be the ultimate. For our family to have two homes. Our kids could someday help us with that. Use the homes as they will. Be there when Maria and I are at the other place or are traveling. Those are the things that I want. To earn enough money to be able to do that sort of thing. For Maria, too. Those are the goals. Those are some of the things that I want and dream about.

Am I having a bit of a midlife crisis now that I am 49? I am not sure. I am starting to see my mortality more than I used to. I am beginning to feel like my time on earth is limited some at this point. I feel it more than I used to. I do want more time. That is one of the big motivators for me to be careful about my health. I guess I have always had limted time. But I feel it now more than I used to. But, whatever, I will continue to live my life like anything is possible. This makes it even more important for me to now waste time and to realize the things that I want to do. 49 is not that old. Remember, PERSPECTIVE. I remember feeling old at 21. That was an illusion. And so is feeling old at 49. I have a lot of life left. There is time to make changes and improve things. Remember what Goggins says about the 40 % rule. That is what most people are putting out. People are more capable than the 40 %.

I was watching the show DESTINED today on ESPN and I came across a quote from Alex Caceres that I really like:

> If you put in work,
> the work is going to be put into you.

I like that one. It's good. And it is the TRUTH.
