  <p>I have admired this filmmaker since I first came across his work in 2003. The first film I saw was 21 GRAMS. It was Iñarritu´s first English language feature and his first film produced in the United States. I remember how moved I was by the beautiful cinematography of<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006509/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"> Rodrigo Prieto</a>. 21 GRAMS had an incredibly honest and heart breaking story, as well as an innovative structure. I had never seen anything in a cinema quite like it before. Soon afterward, I found Iñarritu's first feature, AMORES PERROS, on DVD. I realized that this director was a new cinematic voice that crossed borders, languages and cultures.</p>
<p>For the past 14 years I have gone to each of Inarritu's films as they have come to cinemas and I have been deeply moved by each and every one. I continue to look forward to their release dates and I am sure I will do so well into the future.</p>
