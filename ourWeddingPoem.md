# __Finally Home__

__by John William Davis__

*For Maria Inma*     

I believe in fate now much more than I used to  

Meeting you has changed me  

I trust now that there is a reason

For everything we go through

I find it miraculous  

Today

That two people  

Who come from different languages and cultures  

And climates and economies and world views  

From so far away  

Can come together as one  

In common humanity as loving partners  

I feel with you - in your prescence -  

That I am finally home  

Wherever we are, wherever we live, when I am  

With you, I will always be home  

Whatever the house or street or neighborhood  

Or city or state or country or continent  

When I come back to you at the end or

Beginning of the day -  

I will be coming back  

Home  

And when I open my eyes in the morning -  

If I see you or sense you are there - I will know  

I am home  

With you I am finally home
